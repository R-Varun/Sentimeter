The dependencies are documented and kept in our `requirements.txt` and our `package.json` files. These hold the dependencies for our Python and Node environments respectively. To install the depenencies for Python, run `pip install requirements.txt`, and to install all node dependencies, run npm install in the root directory.

We should now be able to run our application with these out of the way. In root directory, execute `npm start`, and now on your browser, the app should be running on port 3000. Go to `localhost:3000` in the web-browser to view the running app.
